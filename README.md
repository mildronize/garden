## Note

- Asset Co-location: https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/pull/3573

  - 11ty image plugin already support Asset Co-location but when you use space in image name it will not work. So, you have to use `-` or `_` instead of space in image name. [11ty/eleventy-img#253](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img/issues/253) [zachleat](https://github.com/zachleat) said that it will be fixed in v6
