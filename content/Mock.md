## **Mock your APIs for fast, robust and comprehensive testing**

WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. Some might consider it a **service virtualization** tool or a **mock server**.It enables you to **stay productive** when an API you depend on **doesn't exist** or isn't complete. It supports testing of **edge cases and failure modes** that the real API won't reliably produce. And because it's fast it can **reduce your build time** from hours down to minutes.
